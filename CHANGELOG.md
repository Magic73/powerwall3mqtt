## [0.3.1] - 2025-03-09

### Fixed

- [Issue #23](https://github.com/slyglif/powerwall3mqtt/issues/23): Fix the config entry names for MQTT to line up with the names used by HassIO services.  **NOTE: If you need to use the MQTT hostname or username, you will need up update your config before starting the add-on**

## [0.3.0] - 2025-03-01

### Added

- Added binary_sensors for the following:
	- Backfeed Limited Alert: This is an installer configuration option on the Powerwall that limits export to the grid.  It seems to be used to control operation before permission to operate is granted, and is turned off by Tesla once permission is granted.  If it is enabled after you have permission to operate you should probably reach out to Tesla.
	- Battery Comms Alert: Some kind of communication issue between the system and one of it's batteries.
	- Real Power Config Limited Alert: There was a limit placed on the system during commissioning that prevents generating the amount of power requested.
	- Missing Battery Alert: This is my own alert, based on two sections of the system configuration not matching.  It should mean one or more of the batteries are offline.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-03-01

### Fixed

- [Issue #22](https://github.com/slyglif/powerwall3mqtt/issues/22): Added better error handling of errors fetching individual PW vitals (such as PV string info).  Now the app should log an error and continue running, but mark the individual PWs as unavailable in HA.

### Changed

- This release had a major code cleanup and refactoring, simplifying a lot of the individual functions and classes.  With the exception of the protobuf class, it now passes pylint cleanly using the default settings.  It's possible some edge cases could have issues, so please report any stack traces.  This was preparation for adding unit tests in the future.
